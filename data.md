I have ten years of experience in data science and analytics, including substantial experience leading product analytics teams. Data science allows me to combine my research-focused analytical skills with my inquisitive and creative nature. Being presented with a data set, it is often surprising how much information can be garnered through analysis. This page will contain details around my experience and specializations.

### Professional Training 

To help enable my transition from Software Developer (as part of the [Silicon Valley Internship Programme](http://www.siliconvalleyinternship.com/)) into Analytics, I completed a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Analyst Nanodegree. I have discussed how it helped me in the career move and the move from PhD to Industry on [Medium](https://medium.com/@davidjohnwilson/udacity-nanodegree-ideal-route-from-phd-to-industry-1b7ed6b468d2#.1yvxzfli3).
