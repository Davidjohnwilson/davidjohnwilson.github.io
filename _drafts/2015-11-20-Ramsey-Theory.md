(Okay, I lied about the profit part...)

I find math seriously cool. I know this is not necessarily something I should be admitting in a public space, but there's nothing cooler than a piece of math that blows your mind. I've been lucky enough to work on some really interesting math in University and Grad School, so I want to start sharing some of the cooler stuff.
