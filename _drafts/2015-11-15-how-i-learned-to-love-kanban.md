#How I learned to love Kanban

Talk to any of my friends and they'll probably tell you that I'm a busy person. Ask my parents, and they'll definitely tell you I'm a busy person. I can't help it.

Since moving to San Francisco (and moving out of academia) I have felt that there is so much work to do and nowhere near enough time. 


Kanban.

Limits my projects in progress
Forces me to make manageable chunks
