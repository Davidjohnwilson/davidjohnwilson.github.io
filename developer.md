## <i class="fa fa-laptop"></i> Background

I am currently working in San Francisco at [GuideSpark](http://www.guidespark.com), originally being hired as part of the [Silicon Valley Internship Programme](http://www.siliconvalleyinternship.com/). I joined as a Software Engineer and have since been promoted to a Data Engineer role, followed by a Data Scientist position.

This page details my skills and experience, and will be kept up to date with any side-projects I am working on. 

I also completed a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) Data Analyst Nanodegree. I have discussed how it helped me transition into industry following a PhD on [Medium](https://medium.com/@davidjohnwilson/udacity-nanodegree-ideal-route-from-phd-to-industry-1b7ed6b468d2#.1yvxzfli3).
