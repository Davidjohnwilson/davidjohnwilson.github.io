## <i class="fa fa-laptop"></i> Background

I am currently working at [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/careers) in Menlo Park as a Business Intelligence Engineer. I work on the People Insights team, supporting the HR team and leadership. My role currently involves a range of data responsibilities including building pipelines, creating dashboards, productionalizing ML models, and educating stakeholders on understanding data.

Previously I worked at [GuideSpark](http://www.guidespark.com) (originally being hired as part of the [Silicon Valley Internship Programme](http://www.siliconvalleyinternship.com/)). I joined as a Software Engineer and was promoted to a Data Engineer role, followed by a Data Scientist position.

This page details my skills and experience, and will be kept up to date with any side-projects I am working on. 

I also completed a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) Data Analyst Nanodegree. I have discussed how it helped me transition into industry following a PhD on [Medium](https://medium.com/@davidjohnwilson/udacity-nanodegree-ideal-route-from-phd-to-industry-1b7ed6b468d2#.1yvxzfli3).
