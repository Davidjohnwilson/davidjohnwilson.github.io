  <h3>Welcome to the personal website of David John Wilson.</h3>

  <h3><i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i> Data Scientist</h3>
    <p>I am very interested in the increasing role of Data in business, and what can be gleamed from analysis of various data sources. I have experience in working with video-based data, am completing the Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree, and building a portfolio of interesting data studies.</p>
    <p>I will be posting interesting data studies on this site below, as well as discussions of technologies and frameworks I use.</p>

I have spent the last three years completing a <a href="/publications/djwthesis.pdf">PhD in Computer Science</a> (in particular, Computer Algebra and Real Algebraic Geometry) at the University of Bath, supervised by Prof. James H. Davenport and Dr Russell Bradford.</p>
    <p>I have many peer-reviewed publications and have presented at various international conferences.</p>
